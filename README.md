# CDAC-codes-
Practice codes 
This repository contains codes that I wrote to practice and learn different concepts during my CDAC training. The codes cover various topics such as data structures, algorithms, programming languages, and operating systems.

Getting Started

To get started, you can clone this repository using the following command:

bash

git clone https://github.com/niranjan-19/cdac-codes.git

Prerequisites

The codes are written in different programming languages such as C, C++, Java. Therefore, you need to have the appropriate compilers and interpreters installed on your system.
Running the Codes

Each code is stored in a separate directory with a descriptive name that indicates the topic it covers. To run a code, navigate to its directory and follow the instructions in the README file, if any.

Contributing

Feel free to contribute to this repository by adding your own codes or improving the existing ones. You can do this by forking the repository, making your changes, and submitting a pull request.

Acknowledgments

I would like to thank my CDAC instructors for providing me with the knowledge and skills to write these codes.
